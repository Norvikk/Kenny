# Kenny Libraries

This is a C# library to facilitate code writing in C# by removing repetitive long spaghetti code


### Some small examples
(Kenny) - (Equivalent in C#)
 - **W();** -  Console.Write();
 - **WL();** -  Console.WriteLine();
 - **ListW();** - "Write all contents of the List into the console"
 - **ListWL();** - "Write all contents of the List into the console on a new Line each"
 - **Sleep();** - System.Threading.Thread.Sleep();
 
.

### Bigger examples such as: 
 - **Get.UserAnswer();** -  "A highly modular way to request input from the user, whether its only characters, digits or both. Custom error messages and custom despised items"
